## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at the University of Notre Dame studying Physics with a minor in Data Science. I am a member of the Glynn Family Honors Program and currently involved in a nuclear astrophysics research project.

#### Technical Skills

- Python
- Excel

### Goals

By the end of the semester, I hope to become more well versed in different programming dictionaries, specifically with a focus on data analytics and visualizations as I continue my research in nuclear astrophysics. One of my specific goals, specifically in relation to using GitHub and VSCode is to be more intentional and organized in how I store my files. By being more concrete and explicit in where files are and why, I will be able to more easily access different projects. If by the end of the semester I have developed data skills in computing and an organized portfolio, this will set me up for success in future research projects, especially with regard to my research in physics and future experiment I will be running this summer. 

#### Projects

#### [Elements of Computing Projects](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio.git)

For my minor in data science at Notre Dame, I am enrolled in a computing course which covers a wide range of computing skills and applications relevant today for a variety of careers. Consequently, it is necessary to cumulate my completed projects such that I can access them in the future. Here is the repository which organizes and demonstrates what I have and will continue to work on.

The first project within this portfolio is a basic streamlit app titled ["Who are Palmer's Penguins"](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio/basic-streamlit-app.git) which is a simple app in which the user can interact with a basic CSV dataset. The goal of this project was to learn the basic syntax of streamlit and develop an understanding of how streamlit apps work and run. 

#### Analysis of Charge States in Recoil Separator 

Throughout the spring semester of 2024, I worked to develop a code which could compare experimental data with an external model to understand how accurate the model was as a prediction of physical results. I adjusted the data frames of both the experimental results and predictive model such that they were comparing apples to apples so to speak, and then produced visualizations of the overlap.
