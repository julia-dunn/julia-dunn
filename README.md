##### [Elements of Computing Projects](https://github.com/julia-dunn/DUNN-Python-Portfolio.git)

For my minor in data science at Notre Dame, I am enrolled in a computing course which covers a wide range of computing skills and applications relevant today for a variety of careers. Consequently, it is necessary to cumulate my completed projects such that I can access them in the future. Here is the repository which organizes and demonstrates what I have and will continue to work on.

#### Analysis of Charge States in Recoil Separator 

Throughout the spring semester of 2024, I worked to develop a code which could compare experimental data with an external model to understand how accurate the model was as a prediction of physical results. I adjusted the data frames of both the experimental results and predictive model such that they were comparing apples to apples so to speak, and then produced visualizations of the overlap.
